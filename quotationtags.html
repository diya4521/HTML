        <blockquote> A person who is well disciplined is on track and has orderliness in life. 
            Discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishment; hence it is the key to success. 
            Discipline establishes a good basis for being selective, independent, punctual, focused, 
            encouraged, and staying organized in life.
